# Greybird-Platinum PKGBUILD

A PKGBUILD for fellow Arch users to install the "Greybird-Platinum" theme.

## Build Dependencies

- `sassc`
- `meson`
- `librsvg`

Install with `sudo pacman -S sassc meson librsvg`

## Instructions

1. Clone the git repository
2. `cd` into the repo
3. `makepkg`
4. Install the resultant package with `pacman -U`.

## Why not put this in the AUR?

Eventually, that's the plan. Until I get around to ensuring the PKGBUILD meets the submission and packaging guidelines, and figuring out how I'm gonna handle versioning this project going forward, it'll have to live here.
